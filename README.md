# Medical-Image-Fusion

Medical Image Fusion Using Improved Pulse Coupled Neural Network is an
artificial intelligence algorithm that can fuse two medical images into one. It uses the pulse
coupled neural network which is a new form of neural network which can give better outputs
in terms of accuracy, speed and efficiency. This algorithm has been validated using several
cases and the results have been satisfactory. PCNN is able to overcome the limitations of
conventional networks by utilizing the hardware acceleration power of the GPU to increase
the performance of image analysis and registration. With PCNN, it's possible to accurately
classify different types of tissues, segment images into multiple regions, and more.
 It will provide our users with an easy-to-use software where they will be able to upload
different medical images of the same body parts on our software and they will get a fused
image of that body part as a result which will make it much easier for our users to understand
the medical condition.


Just download the latest version of MATLAB from here -> https://in.mathworks.com/products/matlab/student.html

After downloading and succesfully running the MATLAB run the app1.mlapp file from the repository.
